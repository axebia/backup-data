Question 1. du & df Command
            du : The Linux “du” (Disk Usage) is a standard Unix/Linux command, used to check the information of disk usage of files 
                 and directories on a machine. The du command has many parameter options that can be used to get the results in many formats.
                 Example: $du /home/ubuntu
                -h with du command gives result in Human readable form : $du -h /home/ubuntu
            df : The ‘df‘ command stand for “disk filesystem“, it is used to get full summary of available and used disk space usage of 
                 file system on Linux system.
                 Example : $df -h


Question 2. Check the size of any directory which is present on my system.
            $du -h directoryname


Question 3. Check the size of subdirectories in a directory.
            $du -Sh directoryname
            s : summarize display only a total for each argument
            S : display size individually
            h : human-readable


Question 4. List out all the devices which is currently mounted in my system.
            $df -h or check in /etc/mtab


Question 5. List how much resource mounted resources are using.
            $df -h --total


Question 6. print 1st and 5th command line arguments
            


Question 7. print "INDIA" if 2nd argument equal to 10 else it will print "india"

Question 8. print addition of all arguments

Question 9. print the table of command line argument if value is less 10

print 5 times "INDIA" if value is greater than or equal to 10

Question 10. Make a script and print your name 10 times(use function to print your name)



Question 11. SED and AWK command
             SED Stands for : Stream Editor
             SED command is used for editing files even without opening it, which is much quicker way to find and replace 
             something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.
             $sed 's/abc/xyz/' file.txt
             - “s” specifies the substitution operation. The “/” are delimiters. 
                The “abc” is the search pattern and the “xyz” is the replacement string.
             AWK: awk command searches files for text containing a pattern. When a line or text matches,
                  awk performs a specific action on that line/text.
                  Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports.
                  The awk command programming language requires no compiling, and allows the user to use variables,
                  numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. 
                  example: awk '/xyz/ {print}' file.txt 


Question 12. write about exit status
             Every Linux command executed by the shell script or user, has an exit status. The exit status is an integer number. 
             The Linux man pages stats the exit statuses of each command. 0 exit status means the command was successful 
             without any errors. A non-zero (1-255 values) exit status means command was failure.

 
Question 13. Make a excel sheet manually with 5 column, and print the 1st,3rd and 5th column
             $awk -F “,” ‘{print $1 $3 $5}’ /home/xeadmin/file.csv

Question 14. List the sub directories of a directory which are more than 5 mb.
             $ du -ht +5M <directory name>

Question 15. List the mounted devices which are mounted in /dev
             $ df -ah /dev
